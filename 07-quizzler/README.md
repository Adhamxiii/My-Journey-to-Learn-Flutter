# Lesson 6: Quizzler App

In this sixth lesson of my Flutter learning journey, I built the "Quizzler" app, a simple quiz game. This app allowed me to practice breaking down complex problems into smaller classes and methods, creating an interactive quiz experience.

## What I Learned

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: I learned how to break down the quiz app into smaller classes and methods, such as `QuizBrain` and `Question`, to manage the app's logic and data effectively.

- **State Management**: I explored the concept of state management by tracking the current question number and using the `setState` method to update the UI dynamically.

- **UI Building**: I practiced building a UI with various widgets, including `Column`, `Text`, `TextButton`, and `Icon`.

## App Preview

Here's a glimpse of the "Quizzler" app in action:

## Insights Gained

One of the key takeaways from this lesson is the importance of structuring code into manageable classes and methods. By doing so, I was able to create a more organized and maintainable codebase, making it easier to handle complex logic and data.

## Next Steps

With the knowledge gained from this lesson, I'm excited to explore more advanced topics such as state management patterns, app navigation, and integration with APIs to create more interactive and feature-rich apps.
