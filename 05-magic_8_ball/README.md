# Lesson 4: Ask Me Anything - The Challenge

In this fourth and exciting lesson, I took on the "Ask Me Anything" challenge, applying all that I've learned so far in my Flutter learning journey. The challenge involved creating an app where the user can ask a question and get a random answer displayed on a magic ball.

## What I Learned

- **Stateful Widgets**: As in previous lessons, I utilized stateful widgets to manage and update the state of the app dynamically.

- **Random Number Generation**: I implemented random number generation to simulate the magic ball's response using the `Random` class.

- **User Interaction**: I used a `TextButton` widget that responds to user clicks to generate a random answer.

- **Dynamic Image Loading**: To display the random answer, I loaded different ball images dynamically based on the generated number using the `Image.asset` widget.

## Next Steps

I'm proud of the progress I've made throughout this Flutter learning journey, but I'm not stopping here! In the next phase of my journey, I plan to explore more advanced topics, such as state management patterns, app navigation, and integrating APIs to create more interactive and feature-rich apps.
