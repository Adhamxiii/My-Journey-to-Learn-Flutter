# Lesson 3: Building the Dicee App

In this third lesson of my Flutter learning journey, I built the "Dicee" app, a simple dice rolling game. This app demonstrates more advanced concepts such as state management, user interactions, integrating images into the UI, and utilizing Intention Actions.

## What I Learned

- **Stateful Widgets**: I created a `DicePage` class that extends `StatefulWidget`, allowing me to manage and update the state of the app.

- **Random Number Generation**: I used the `Random` class to generate random numbers, simulating the roll of two dice.

- **State Management**: I utilized the `setState` method to update the state of the app when the user interacts with the dice buttons.

- **User Interaction**: I implemented `TextButton` widgets that respond to user clicks to roll the dice.

- **Dynamic Image Loading**: I loaded dice images dynamically based on the generated dice numbers using the `Image.asset` widget.

- **Layout**: I organized the UI elements using the `Row` and `Expanded` widgets to create a visually appealing and responsive layout.

- **Intention Action**: I learned how to use Intention Actions to quickly perform common coding tasks in my IDE, such as generating code and applying fixes.

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, I'll continue to enhance my Flutter skills by exploring more complex user interfaces, state management patterns, and creating interactive experiences.
