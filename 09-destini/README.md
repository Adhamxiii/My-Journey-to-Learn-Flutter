# Lesson 7: Destini - Your Interactive Story App

In Lesson 7, I tackled the Destini challenge, where I built an interactive story app using Flutter. The challenge pushed me to apply the concepts I've learned throughout my Flutter journey and create a text-based adventure game.

## What I Learned

- **Object-Oriented Programming:** I continued to reinforce my understanding of OOP principles by creating classes such as `StoryBrain` and `Story` to organize and manage the story data.

- **State Management:** The challenge required careful state management to handle changing story scenarios, updating UI elements, and controlling the flow of the story based on user choices.

- **UI Design and Styling:** I gained more experience in designing and styling UI elements, including buttons and text, to enhance the user experience and create an immersive storytelling environment.

- **User Interactions:** The app heavily relied on user interactions to progress the story. I practiced implementing button taps to trigger the next story steps and choices.

- **Conditional Logic:** I employed conditional statements to control the story progression based on user choices, ensuring that the correct story segments were displayed.

- **Container and SafeArea:** I utilized the `Container` widget to manage the layout and background image of the app. The `SafeArea` widget helped ensure that UI elements were visible and not obstructed by device edges.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
