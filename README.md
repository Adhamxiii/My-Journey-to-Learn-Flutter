# My Journey to Learn Flutter

Welcome to my Flutter learning journey repository! In this repository, I'll be documenting my progress, lessons, and projects as I embark on a journey to master Flutter app development. Follow along to witness my growth and exploration in the world of Flutter!

## About Me

I am a passionate developer who is enthusiastic about mobile app development and excited to dive into the Flutter framework. This repository will serve as a record of my learning process, where I will share my experiences, insights, and code snippets as I tackle various aspects of Flutter development.

## Lessons and Projects

### Lesson 1: "I Am Rich" App

In the first lesson of my Flutter journey, I created a simple app named "I Am Rich." This app introduced me to the fundamental concepts of Flutter, including widgets, basic UI layout, and asset management. Check out the [lesson details](01-i_am_rich) for a deep dive into what I learned and the code I wrote.

### Lesson 2: Personal Profile App

In the second lesson, I built a personal profile app that showcases my information using various Flutter widgets and layouts. I learned about creating layouts with `Column`, customizing text styles, using `CircleAvatar` for profile pictures, and organizing information with `Card` and `ListTile` widgets. Dive into the [lesson details](02-mi_card) to explore the insights gained and the code implemented.

### Lesson 3: Dicee App

In the third lesson, I created the "Dicee" app, a simple dice rolling game. This lesson taught me about stateful widgets, user interactions, dynamic image loading, and utilizing Intention Actions for efficient coding tasks. Discover more about my learning journey in [lesson details](03-dicee).

### Lesson 4: Roll Dice App

In the fourth lesson, I designed the "Roll Dice" app, a simple application that simulates rolling dice. This lesson introduced me to random number generation, user interactions, and building a responsive UI. Explore more about the lesson in [lesson 4](04-roll_dice).


### Lesson 5: Ask Me Anything - The Challenge

In the fifth and exciting lesson, I took on the "Ask Me Anything" challenge, applying all that I've learned so far in my Flutter learning journey. The challenge involved creating an app where the user can ask a question and get a random answer displayed on a magic ball. Check out the [lesson details](05-magic_8_ball) to see how I tackled the challenge and what I learned.

### Lesson 6: Xylophone App

In the sixtth lesson, I developed the "Xylophone" app, a virtual xylophone instrument. This lesson introduced me to audio playback, user interactions, and creating a visually appealing UI. Explore the insights gained and the code implemented in [lesson 6](06-xylophone).

### Lesson 7: Quizzler App

In the seventh lesson, I built the "Quizzler" app, a simple quiz game. This lesson allowed me to practice object-oriented programming, state management, and building UIs with various widgets. Dive into [lesson 7](07-quizzler) to learn more about my experience and what I learned.

### Lesson 8: Flutter Quiz App

In the eighth lesson, I built the "Flutter Quiz" app, a quiz application to test users' knowledge about Flutter. This lesson covered creating dynamic widgets, quiz logic, and result calculation. Discover the insights and code implementation in [lesson 8](08-flutter_quiz).


### Lesson 9: Destini App - Choose Your Own Adventure!

In the ninth lesson, I took on an exciting challenge by building the "Destini" app, a choose-your-own-adventure story. This project pushed my skills further as I navigated through complex story scenarios, managed user choices, and controlled the flow of the narrative. Check out [lesson 9](09-destini) to explore the app and read about my journey in building it.

### Lesson 10: Meals App

The tenth lesson involved creating the "Meals" app, a recipe application that allows users to browse, filter, and save meals. I learned about navigation, state management, and creating a beautiful user interface. Details are available in [lesson 10](10-meals).

### Lesson 11: Shopping List App

In the eleventh lesson, I developed the "Shopping List" app, an application that enables users to manage their shopping lists. This lesson explored local data storage, CRUD operations, and list management. Dive into [lesson 11](11-shopping_list) to learn more about the project.

### Lesson 12: Todo List App

The twelfth lesson was focused on the "Todo List" app, a simple yet efficient application to manage daily tasks. This lesson covered data models, task management, and UI representation. Explore [lesson 12](12-todo_list) for more insights.

### Lesson 13: Expense Tracker App

In the thirteenth lesson, I created the "Expense Tracker" app, a financial management application. This lesson involved managing complex data, chart representation, and user input validation. Check out [lesson 13](13-expense_tracker) for details.

### Lesson 14: Favorite Places App

The fourteenth lesson was about the "Favorite Places" app, enabling users to save and display their favorite locations. This lesson explored device features like maps, location services, and data persistence. Explore [lesson 14](14-favorite_places) for more insights.

### Lesson 15: Chat App

In the fifteenth lesson, I created a real-time chat application using Flutter and Firebase. This app allowed users to communicate in real-time, implementing features like user authentication, message sending, and real-time data updates. [lesson 15](15-chat_app) details my learning process and code implementation.
