# Lesson 5: Xylophone App

In this fifth lesson of my Flutter learning journey, I created the "Xylophone" app, which emulates a xylophone instrument. This app allowed me to explore audio playback, user interactions, and building a visually appealing UI.

## What I Learned

- **Audio Playback**: I integrated the `audioplayers` package to play audio files in response to user interactions, creating a realistic xylophone experience.

- **Widgets Styling**: I used the `TextButton.styleFrom` method to customize the button appearance, giving each xylophone key a unique color.

- **Building a UI Layout**: I arranged the xylophone keys using a `Column` widget, setting up a responsive layout to accommodate different screen sizes.

## App Preview

Here's a glimpse of the "Xylophone" app in action:

## Next Steps

I'm thrilled with the progress I've made in my Flutter journey so far, and I'm eager to continue advancing my skills. In the next phase, I plan to delve into state management, app navigation, and more complex UI designs.
